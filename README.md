# Secure-Quiz-App
Secure Quiz App is a mobile application for android  devices. 
This android application can be used to conduct quizzes in a classroom setting environment  using the wifi of the device. 
The App. asks the candidate to fill-in a short form consisting of basic personal details and then connects to the web where the subject instructor can provide the questions of the quiz using google forms.

###Security Features
>Once the student opens the app and sets it as the default home launcher app , 
she is not allowed to exit or minimize the app without pressing the Exit button. 
This is so because this app disables the “back” as well as the “home” button of the device. 
Even the task switching button of the device is disabled so as to disallow the user from using any other app while attempting the quiz.

>Students are ,by all means, disconnected from the outside world while attempting the quiz.  
This means that one cannot use mobile data and bluetooth features of the device while running the app. 
Plugging in the headset is also not allowed. Due to this feature , 
students cannot transfer any files or browse the internet hence refraining them to follow any unfair means or 
cheating practices while attempting the quiz.

>Since there is no way of ensuring that a student  from outside the classroom doesn’t attend the quiz, 
a symbol login feature is added in the app. 
Without this feature, if a student is able to send the google form link to someone outside the classroom, 
we cannot stop the one sitting outside to attempt the quiz. Using the special symbol login feature one cannot , 
in any way communicate the symbol password outside the exam hall.
